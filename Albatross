a large seabird known for its majestic wingspan and its association with the poem "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

In the realm of ocean's boundless flight,
A bird of wonder graces sight,
The albatross with wings so wide,
Gliding where the waters bide.

Its wingspan vast, a soaring dream,
On ocean currents, it's supreme,
A master of the open sky,
In solitude, it loves to fly.

With feathers white, a graceful gown,
Above the waves, it journeys down,
A wanderer of windswept blue,
A creature of the ocean's hue.
